                    Chunked Oblivious HTTP Messages
                  draft-ietf-ohai-chunked-ohttp-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a variant of the Oblivious HTTP message format
   that allows chunks of requests and responses to be encrypted and
   decrypted before the entire request or response is processed.  This
   allows incremental processing of Oblivious HTTP messages, which is
   particularly useful for handling large messages or systems that
   process messages slowly.

1.  Introduction

   Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] defines a system for sending HTTP requests and
   responses as encrypted messages.  Clients send requests via a relay
   to a gateway, which is able to decrypt and forward the request to a
   target server.  Responses are encrypted with an ephemeral symmetric
   key by the gateway and sent back to the client via the relay.  The
   messages are protected with Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE;
   [HPKE]), and are intended to prevent the gateway from linking any two
   independent requests to the same client.

   The definition of Oblivious HTTP in [OHTTP] encrypts messages such
   that entire request and response bodies need to be received before
   any of the content can be decrypted.  This is well-suited for many of
   the use cases of Oblivious HTTP, such as DNS queries or metrics
   reporting.

   However, some applications of Oblivious HTTP can benefit from being
   able to encrypt and decrypt parts of the messages in chunks.  If a
   request or response can be processed by a receiver in separate parts,
   and is particularly large or will be generated slowly, then sending a
   series of encrypted chunks can improve the performance of
   applications.

   Incremental delivery of responses allows an Oblivious Gateway
   Resource to provide Informational (1xx) responses (Section 15.2 of
   [HTTP]).

   This document defines an optional message format for Oblivious HTTP
   that supports the progressive creation and processing of both
   requests and responses.  New media types are defined for this
   purpose.

1.1.  Applicability

   Like the non-chunked variant, chunked Oblivious HTTP has limited
   applicability as described in Section 2.1 of [OHTTP], and requires
   the use of a willing Oblivious Relay Resource and Oblivious Gateway
   Resource.

   Chunked Oblivious HTTP is intended to be used in cases for where the
   privacy properties of Oblivious HTTP are needed -- specifically,
   removing linkage at the transport layer between separate HTTP
   requests -- but incremental processing is also needed for performance
   or functionality.

   One specific functional capability that requires chunked Oblivious
   HTTP is support for Informational (1xx) responses (Section 15.2 of
   [HTTP]).

   In order to be useful, the content of chunked Oblivious HTTP needs to
   be possible to process incrementally.  Since incremental processing
   means that the message might end up being truncated, for example in
   the case of an error on the underlying transport, applications also
   need to be prepared to safely handle incomplete messages (see
   Section 7 for more discussion).  Choices about how the inner content
   is structured can be made independently of this chunked format; that
   is, Binary HTTP chunks do need not to align with those of OHTTP.

   Applications that use the Indeterminate format of Binary HTTP
   (Section 3.2 of [BHTTP]) are well-suited to using chunked Oblivious
   HTTP as it enables incremental construction of messages.  That only
   applies to construction; how a message can be processed after
   decryption depends on how the format is processed.  Binary HTTP
   messages in any format (either Known- or Indeterminate-Length) can be
   incrementally processed.

   Chunked Oblivious HTTP is not intended to be used for long-lived
   sessions between clients and servers that might build up state, or as
   a replacement for a proxied TLS session.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Notational conventions from [OHTTP] are used in this document.

3.  Chunked Requests and Responses

   Chunked Oblivious HTTP defines different media types than the non-
   chunked variant.  These media types are "message/ohttp-chunked-req"
   (defined in Section 8.1) and "message/ohttp-chunked-res" (defined in
   Section 8.2).  If a request uses the media type "message/ohttp-
   chunked-req", a successful corresponding response MUST use the media
   type "message/ohttp-chunked-res".

   Use cases that require the use of Chunked OHTTP SHOULD only use the
   chunked media types for their requests, to indicate that Chunked
   OHTTP is required.  If the gateway unexpectedly does not support
   Chunked OHTTP, then the request will fail as if OHTTP as a whole were
   not supported.  If clients retry requests with the non-chunked media
   type, a gateway could partition client anonymity sets by rejecting
   some requests and accepting others.

   Chunked OHTTP requests and responses SHOULD include the Incremental
   header field set to ?1 [INCREMENTAL].  This signals to intermediaries
   -- the relay in particular -- that the content of the messages are
   intended to be delivered incrementally.  Without this signal,
   intermediaries might buffer request or response body until complete,
   removing some of the benefits of using Chunked OHTTP.

   Incremental processing of messages does not always require
   incremental forwarding in the network.  An endpoint might reasonably
   omit the Incremental header field if it only wants to support
   incremental processing of a complete message.

   Chunked OHTTP messages generally will not include a Content-Length
   header field, since the complete length of all chunks might not be
   known ahead of time.

   For example, a Chunked OHTTP request could look like the following:

   POST /request.example.net/proxy HTTP/1.1
   Host: proxy.example.org
   Content-Type: message/ohttp-chunked-req
   Incremental: ?1
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   <content is an Encapsulated Request>

   Implementations MUST support receiving chunks that contain 2^14
   (16384) octets of data prior to encapsulation.  Senders of chunks
   SHOULD limit their chunks to this size, unless they are aware of
   support for larger sizes by the receiving party.

4.  Request Format

   Chunked OHTTP requests start with the same header as used for the
   non-chunked variant, which consists of a key ID, algorithm IDs, and
   the KEM shared secret.  This header is followed by chunks of data
   protected with HPKE, each of which is preceded by a variable-length
   integer (as defined in Section 16 of [QUIC]) that indicates the
   length of the chunk.

   The final chunk is preceded by a length field with the value 0, which
   means the chunk extends to the end of the outer stream.  This format
   relies on its length being indicated by the protocol that carries the
   message; for HTTP, the final chunk ends at the end of the HTTP
   message content.

   Chunked Encapsulated Request {
     Chunked Request Header (56 + 8 * Nenc),
     Chunked Request Chunks (..),
   }

   Chunked Request Header {
     Key Identifier (8),
     HPKE KEM ID (16),
     HPKE KDF ID (16),
     HPKE AEAD ID (16),
     KEM Encapsulated Key (8 * Nenc),
   }

   Chunked Request Chunks {
     Non-Final Request Chunk (..) ...,
     Final Request Chunk Indicator (i) = 0,
     HPKE-Protected Final Chunk (..),
   }

   Non-Final Request Chunk {
     Length (i) = 1..,
     HPKE-Protected Chunk (..),
   }

               Figure 1: Chunked Encapsulated Request Format

   The content of the HPKE-protected chunks is defined in Section 6.1.

5.  Response Format

   Chunked OHTTP responses start with a nonce, followed by chunks of
   data protected with an AEAD.  Each chunk is preceded by a variable-
   length integer that indicates the length of the chunk.

   The final chunk is preceded by a length field with the value 0, which
   means the chunk extends to the end of the outer stream.

   Chunked Encapsulated Response {
     Response Nonce (8 * max(Nn, Nk)),
     Chunked Response Chunks (..),
   }

   Chunked Response Chunks {
     Non-Final Response Chunk (..) ...,
     Final Response Chunk Indicator (i) = 0,
     AEAD-Protected Final Response Chunk (..),
   }

   Non-Final Response Chunk {
     Length (i) = 1..,
     AEAD-Protected Chunk (..),
   }

               Figure 2: Chunked Encapsulated Response Format

6.  Encapsulation of Chunks

   The encapsulation of chunked Oblivious HTTP requests and responses
   uses the same approach as the non-chunked variant, with the
   difference that the bodies of requests and responses are sealed and
   opened in chunks, instead of as a whole.

   The AEAD that protects both requests and responses protects
   individual chunks from modification or truncation.  Additionally,
   chunk authentication protects two other pieces of information:

   1.  the order of the chunks (the sequence number of each chunk),
       which is included in the nonce of each chunk.

   2.  which chunk is the final chunk, which is indicated by a sentinel
       in the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) of the final chunk.

   The format of the outer packaging that carries the chunks (the length
   prefix for each chunk specifically) is not explicitly authenticated.
   This allows the chunks to be transported by alternative means, and
   still be valid as long as the order and finality are preserved.  In
   particular, the variable-length encoding used for lengths allows for
   different expressions of the same value, where the choice between
   equivalent encodings is not authenticated.

   When translating from an HTTP message that is already divided into
   chunks -- such as the chunked transfer coding in HTTP/1.1
   (Section 7.1 of [HTTP/1.1]) or DATA frames in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
   (Section 6.1 of [HTTP/2] and Section 7.2.1 of [HTTP/3]) -- there is
   no expectation that any chunks align.  As noted in Section 1.1, the
   chunking of the encapsulated binary HTTP message and the binary HTTP
   message do not need to be aligned.

   A non-final chunk MUST NOT contain a zero-length plaintext.  A
   receiver MUST treat the receipt of a chunk that contains no data as
   equivalent to a decryption error, unless that chunk is the final
   chunk.

6.1.  Request Encapsulation

   For requests, the setup of the HPKE context and the encrypted request
   header is the same as the non-chunked variant.  This is the Chunked
   Request Header defined in Section 4.

   hdr = concat(encode(1, key_id),
                encode(2, kem_id),
                encode(2, kdf_id),
                encode(2, aead_id))
   info = concat(encode_str("message/bhttp chunked request"),
                 encode(1, 0),
                 hdr)
   enc, sctxt = SetupBaseS(pkR, info)
   enc_request_hdr = concat(hdr, enc)

   Each chunk is sealed using the HPKE context.  For non-final chunks,
   the AAD is empty.

   sealed_chunk = sctxt.Seal("", chunk)
   sealed_chunk_len = varint_encode(len(sealed_chunk))
   non_final_chunk = concat(sealed_chunk_len, sealed_chunk)

   The final chunk in a request uses an AAD of the ASCII string "final"
   (0x66696e616c) and is prefixed with a zero length.

   sealed_final_chunk = sctxt.Seal("final", chunk)
   final_chunk = concat(varint_encode(0), sealed_final_chunk)

   HPKE already maintains a sequence number for sealing operations as
   part of the context, so the order of chunks is protected.  HPKE will
   produce an error if the sequence number overflows, which puts a limit
   on the number of chunks that can be sent in a request.

6.2.  Response Encapsulation

   For responses, the first piece of data sent back is the response
   nonce, as in the non-chunked variant.  As in the non-chunked variant,
   the length of the nonce is max(Nn, Nk), where Nn and Nk are the
   length of the AEAD nonce and key.

   entropy_len = max(Nn, Nk)
   response_nonce = random(entropy_len)

   Each chunk is sealed using the same AEAD key and AEAD nonce that are
   derived for the non-chunked variant, which are calculated as follows:

  secret = context.Export("message/bhttp chunked response", entropy_len)
  salt = concat(enc, response_nonce)
  prk = Extract(salt, secret)
  aead_key = Expand(prk, "key", Nk)
  aead_nonce = Expand(prk, "nonce", Nn)

   The sender also maintains a counter of chunks, which is set to 0 for
   the first chunk and incremented by 1 after encoding each chunk.

   counter = 0

   The AEAD nonce is XORed with the counter for encrypting (and
   decrypting) each chunk.  For non-final chunks, the AAD is empty.

   chunk_nonce = aead_nonce XOR encode(Nn, counter)
   sealed_chunk = Seal(aead_key, chunk_nonce, "", chunk)
   sealed_chunk_len = varint_encode(len(sealed_chunk))
   non_final_chunk = concat(sealed_chunk_len, sealed_chunk)
   counter++

   The final chunk in a response uses an AAD of the string "final" and
   is prefixed with a zero length.

   chunk_nonce = aead_nonce XOR encode(Nn, counter)
   sealed_final_chunk = Seal(aead_key, chunk_nonce, "final", chunk)
   final_chunk = concat(varint_encode(0), sealed_final_chunk)

   If the counter reached the maximum value that can be held in an
   integer with Nn bytes (that maximum being 256^Nn), where Nn is the
   length of the AEAD nonce, the chunk_nonce would wrap and be reused.
   Therefore, the response MUST NOT use 256^Nn or more chunks.  However,
   this limit does not consider security margins; see Section 7.3.

7.  Security Considerations

   In general, Chunked OHTTP inherits the same security considerations
   as Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP].  Note specifically that while Chunked
   OHTTP allows for incremental delivery and processing of messages, it
   does not add forward secrecy between chunks.  As with the non-chunked
   variant, forward secrecy is only provided when changing the key
   configuration.  This is particularly important when chunking is used
   to enable interactivity.

   The use of Chunked OHTTP can be considered part of the configuration
   a client knows about for a particular gateway.  As such, the use of
   Chunked OHTTP falls under the same consistency privacy considerations
   as the rest of the configuration (see Section 7 of [OHTTP]).
   Specifically, clients SHOULD NOT fall back from Chunked OHTTP to the
   non-chunked variant if they are configured to used chunking.  Falling
   back would allow clients to have inconsistent behavior that could be
   used to partition client anonymity sets.

7.1.  Message Truncation

   The primary advantage of a chunked encoding is that chunked requests
   or responses can be generated or processed incrementally.  However,
   for a recipient in particular, processing an incomplete message can
   have security consequences.

   The potential for message truncation is not a new concern for HTTP.
   All versions of HTTP provide incremental delivery of messages.  For
   this use of Oblivious HTTP, incremental processing that might result
   in side-effects demands particular attention as Oblivious HTTP does
   not provide strong protection against replay attacks; see Section 6.5
   of [OHTTP].  Truncation might be the result of interference at the
   network layer, or by a malicious Oblivious Relay Resource.

   Endpoints that receive chunked messages can perform early processing
   if the risks are understood and accepted.  Conversely, endpoints that
   depend on having a complete message MUST ensure that they do not
   consider a message complete until having received a chunk with a
   0-valued length prefix, which was successfully decrypted using the
   expected sentinel value, "final", in the AAD.

7.2.  Interactivity and Privacy

   Without chunking, Oblivious HTTP involves a single request and
   response, with no further interactivity.  Using a chunked variant at
   both Client and Oblivious Gateway Resource creates the possibility
   that an exchange could lead to multiple rounds of interaction.
   Information from early chunks from a peer could influence how an
   endpoint constructs later chunks of their message.  However, the use
   of Chunked OHTTP does not necessarily mean that exchanges will
   involve interactivity.

   Interactivity for Chunked OHTTP can be defined as any case in which
   the response can influence the timing or content of the request.  To
   help explain this distinction, the following scenarios can be used to
   understand different modalities for requests and responses:

   *  The request is sent as a single chunk, and the response is sent as
      a single chunk.  This is a non-interactive case that is identical
      to the non-chunked variant.

   *  The request is sent as a single chunk, and the response is sent in
      multiple chunks.  This is a non-interactive case, because there is
      no possibility that the client can influence its request based on
      the response content.

   *  The request is sent in multiple chunks, but either all chunks are
      sent before a response chunk is received, or the sending of the
      chunks is not influenced by the response chunks.  This is a non-
      interactive case, since again the client's request is not
      influenced by any response content.

   *  The request is sent in multiple chunks, at least one of which
      specifically is sent after receiving -- and possibly processing --
      a response chunk (or the complete response), where the response
      influences the timing and/or content of the request chunk.  This
      is an interactive case.

   In the interactive case, the Oblivious Gateway Resource can observe
   the round trip time to the Client, which can change the privacy
   assumptions of the system.

   Any interactivity also allows a network adversary (including the
   Oblivious Relay Resource) to measure the round-trip delay from
   themselves to the Client.

   Client implementations therefore need to be aware of the possibility
   that interactively processing chunks might reveal round-trip time
   information that would be kept private in a non-interactive exchange.

   For cases when interactivity introduces unacceptable risks, the
   client can ensure that it never has an interactive exchange, either
   by not sending its request in multiple chunks, or by ensuring that
   the sending of request chunks cannot be influenced by the response.

   Interactivity that is deliberate might be acceptable.  For instance,
   the 100-continue feature in HTTP, which has the client withhold the
   body of a request until it receives a 100 Informational response, is
   not possible without an interactive exchange.  This highlights the
   risks involved in the use of this chunked encoding to adapt an
   existing HTTP-based interaction to use Oblivious HTTP as such an
   adaptation might not achieve expected privacy outcomes.

   Interactivity does not inherently reduce replay risk unless the
   server explicitly verifies that a client is live (such as by having
   the client echo content from the response in its request).  A request
   that is generated interactively can be replayed by a malicious relay.

7.3.  Message Size Limits

   The security margins for many ciphers degrade as more data is
   protected.  The total size of messages needs to be limited to limit
   the ability of an attacker to compromise cipher confidentiality and
   integrity.

   The multi-user analysis in Section 6 of [AEAD-LIMITS] describes a
   process for estimating limits on usage that maintain security
   margins.  For instance, that analysis shows that to keep the
   Authenticated Encryption Advantage (AEA) for AEAD_AES_GCM_128 below
   2^-50, the total number of bytes protected by a key can be kept below
   2^80, divided by the total number of bytes protected by any key.
   Therefore, for a target advantage of 2^-50, no message can exceed
   2^40 bytes protected with AEAD_AES_GCM_128.

   The use of most AEAD ciphers is subject to a hard limit on ciphertext
   length.  For this format, this limit applies to each chunk and is
   determined by the C_MAX parameter of the AEAD; see [AEAD].  AEAD
   ciphers also have a hard limit on the total number of chunks, which
   is 256^Nn.  These hard Limits on chunk size and count apply to both
   request and response.

Appendix A.  Example

   A single request and response exchange is shown here.  This follows
   the same basic setup as the example in Appendix A of [OHTTP].

   The Oblivious Gateway Resource key pair is generated with a X25519
   secret key of:

   1c190d72acdbe4dbc69e680503bb781a932c70a12c8f3754434c67d8640d8698

   The corresponding key configuration is:

   010020668eb21aace159803974a4c67f08b4152d29bed10735fd08f98ccdd6fe
   09570800080001000100010003

   This key configuration is somehow obtained by the Client, which
   constructs a binary HTTP request:

   00034745540568747470730b6578616d706c652e636f6d012f

   The client constructs an HPKE sending context with a secret key of:

   b26d565f3f875ed480d1abced3d665159650c99174fd0b124ac4bda0c64ae324

   The corresponding public key is:

   8811eb457e100811c40a0aa71340a1b81d804bb986f736f2f566a7199761a032

   The context is created with an info parameter of:

   6d6573736167652f6268747470206368756e6b65642072657175657374000100
   2000010001

   This produces an encrypted message, allowing the Client to construct
   the following Encapsulated Request:

   01002000010001
   8811eb457e100811c40a0aa71340a1b81d804bb986f736f2f566a7199761a032
   1c2ad24942d4d692563012f2980c8fef437a336b9b2fc938ef77a5834f
   1d2e33d8fd25577afe31bd1c79d094f76b6250ae6549b473ecd950501311
   001c6c1395d0ef7c1022297966307b8a7f

   This message contains a header, the encapsulated secret, and three
   encrypted chunks.  Line breaks are included above to show where these
   chunks start.

   The encrypted chunks are the result of invoking the HPKE
   ContextS.Seal() function three times: the first with 12 bytes of the
   request, the second with the remaining 13 bytes, and the last
   containing no data.  This final chunk is marked by a zero length in
   the encoding and an AAD of "final" to protect against undetected
   message truncation.  Each chunk is expanded by 16 bytes for AEAD
   protection.

      |  A BSD-like read() interface that returns 0 when it reaches the
      |  end of a stream naturally leads to a zero-length chunk like
      |  this if the data returned is protected immediately.

   After sending this to the Oblivious Relay Resource, the Oblivious
   Gateway Resource decrypts and processes this message.  The Target
   Resource produces a response like:

   0140c8

   The response is protected by exporting a secret from the HPKE
   context, using input keying material of:

   1d4484834ae36102a6ac42a5523454d9

   The salt is:

   8811eb457e100811c40a0aa71340a1b81d804bb986f736f2f566a7199761a032
   bcce7f4cb921309ba5d62edf1769ef09

   From these, HKDF-SHA256 produces a pseudorandom key of:

   3967884b5f7b4bce4a5320a3e3f79fdc97389f7deba1c1e11c5ea62278187786

   The resulting AES-GCM key is:

   8209f78f2a1610d80c7125009b00aff0

   The 12-byte base nonce is:

   fead854635d2d5527d64f546

   The AEAD Seal() function is then used to encrypt the response in
   chunks to produce the Encapsulated Response:

   bcce7f4cb921309ba5d62edf1769ef09
   1179bf1cc87fa0e2c02de4546945aa3d1e48
   12b348b5bd4c594c16b6170b07b475845d1f32
   00ed9d8a796617a5b27265f4d73247f639

   This example is split onto separate lines to show the nonce and three
   chunks: the first with one byte of response, the second with the
   remaining two bytes, and the final with zero bytes of data.

   The nonces for processing the chunks are, in order:

   fead854635d2d5527d64f546
   fead854635d2d5527d64f547
   fead854635d2d5527d64f544
