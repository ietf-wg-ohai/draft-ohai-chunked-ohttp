I will observe that there are some critical differences between this design and the TLS record layer analysis that might make this less obvious:\n\n1. Proofs of TLS won't have included undetectable truncation of the data stream at record boundaries.  TLS includes a stream termination signal, but it's not at the record layer and it is rarely used.  This design has an integral end-of-stream indicator that is (I believe) very hard to break.\n2. The TLS record layer has padding, which we don't use.\n3. The HPKE part has the same stream terminator design as the response piece.\n\nIntuitively at least, the padding thing would seem to simplify any analysis, but the stream termination would be somewhat new.  Either way, I'm not sure that an analysis would be anything other than a nice feature.",

I understand that Tommy discovered a few like this after implementing and deploying this.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if such an approach would be possible or beneficial for the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHTTP/2 and HTTP/3 allows clients a issue large number of requests at once (e.g., 100). But servers often do not process all requests in parallel. It is often the case that the number of requests that are processed concurrently is rather small (e.g., 10), while other requests are \"buffered.\" By doing so, the backend applications are protected from DoS attacks, while the bandwidth of the connection is fully utilized.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase, the ability to buffer requests is a key pillar of HTTP/2 and 3. It is not a misfeature.\r\n\r\nCONNECT and extended CONNECT are exceptions. That is fine, because every intermediary would recognize that they are exceptions. When receiving too many requests at once, they have the option to respond with 429 Too Many Requests.\r\n\r\nBut POST does not work like that. Proxies are designed to be transparent to the content-type being used.\r\n\r\nThe problem with current design is that it requires proxies to have a list of mime types that have to be processed like CONNECT. I do not see a reason to choose such an approach when we can choose to use extended CONNECT that provides the necessary semantics.",

Apache HTTP server + mod_php) is to use Nginx as a buffer for reducing concurrency. Preforking servers cannot handle as many connections as a event-driven server does. Therefore, it makes (or made) sense to let Nginx to buffer highly concurrent but slowly arriving requests until the entire request is received. Once each request is received completely, Nginx opens a connection to the backend and starts forwarding the request.\r\n\r\nProxies do provide knobs for changing the behavior. In case of Nginx, the knob is [`proxy_request_buffering`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_request_buffering). But the default is `on`, meaning that Nginx will try to buffer the entire request.\r\n\r\n@tfpauly \r\n> My initial inclination is to interpret this how @martinthomson does \u2014 essentially, that while POST clients \"cannot rely on incremental delivery\" in general, specific services can indeed provide incremental delivery where it is beneficial and desirable.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I agree with the interpretation considering that the MUST NOT in RFC 9205 section 3.1 follows this sentence: _This split between generic and application-specific semantics allows an HTTP message to be handled by common software (e.g., HTTP servers, intermediaries, client implementations, and caches) **without requiring those implementations to understand the application in use**_ (emphasis mine).\r\n\r\nBut even if we ignore RFC 9205, I'm still stuck with [this question](https://github.com/ietf-wg-ohai/draft-ohai-chunked-ohttp/issues/19#issuecomment-2026468705).\r\n\r\nTo me, all the argument to use HTTP POST for Chunked OHTTTP seem to be equally applicable to WebSockets over H2/H3, masque, or connect-tcp. The arguments can be (or could have been) used to say that masque or connect-tcp should be built on top of HTTP POST, because the servers / intermediaries could be configured to start forwarding bytes without buffering at a per-resource basis.\r\n\r\nBut we chose to use extended CONNECT.

A possible use case of this Known-length BHTTP + Chunked OHTTP is for transferring very big files like a software update.\n\nThinking through the 4 combos:\n\n1. Known-length BHTTP + regular OHTTP -- straightforward\n2. Known-length BHTTP + Chunked OHTTP -- **need clarification around whether supported**\n3. Indeterminate-length BHTTP + regular OHTTP -- kind of pointless, since need to know length before sending one OHTTP message\n4. Indeterminate-length BHTTP + Chunked OHTTP -- streaming use case\n\n",

The nice thing about that arrangement is that incremental processing is available, regardless of how the BHTTP message is structured.

Therefore, the response MUST NOT use 256Nn or more chunks.

If a sender is going to hit a limit and be unable to send more chunks, they lose the ability to send secure signals to the peer (such as putting trailers in BHTTP to explain that an error condition was hit).\n\nOne solution is to recommend that if the sender is about to hit the limit of number of chunks, it SHOULD stop at least one before the limit to allow sending an application-level error in a final chunk.",

That is, ABORT!\n\nThat would look like a truncation error to the peer, which is something that any peer should probably handle gracefully.  They are processing a lot to get to that point, so if they aren't doing incremental processing with a way to manage possible truncation, I'd be disappointed (though not surprised).\n\nIn practice, the limits we care about are soft, so you don't need to worry about going one chunk over if you really do hit limits.  The risk that an attack is successful increases constantly as you send more data, so another chunk probably won't hurt if that's your choice.  I still wouldn't bother.",

That said, I think it's more nuanced than what the current truncation text provides. I also think it's reasonable to not provide any normative text describing what to do here in any case. However, I think failing to discuss the ways in which this problem can manifest does the reader a disservice. (This question exists because someone didn't know the answer to the text!) As an example, let's say the gateway fails to encap and then aborts. Does the relay also abort its client connection, or does the relay close the stream, or something else? Again, I don't think you need to say precisely what happens, but merely providing an example of how this situation can manifest in practice might service future implementers.",

Rather than signaling the final chunk through the AAD, which adds one extra invocation of the authenticator for that final chunk, rather than construct the nonce like this:\n\n```\nnonce = nonce_base ^ encode(Nn, counter)\n```\n\nYou can encode the per-chunk nonce as:\n\n```\nnonce = nonce_base ^ encode(Nn, counter << 1 | is_final)\n```\n\nThe cost is that you get to send half as many chunks before nonce rollover.  That's still 2^95 chunks of at least one byte each, which is far greater than any safe limit on usage.\n\nI'm going to close this issue immediately, but it's worth noting the idea, in case we need to take another swing.",

For instance, to maintain a decent security margin in AES-GCM, you need to keep well below about 2^31 bytes protected if you want to keep the multiuser security advantage below 2^-50.  That's a LOT lower than 2^96.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm going to approve and merge, but then I need to do a follow-up.",
